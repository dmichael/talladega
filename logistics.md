# Logistics

For the duration of the residency, we will be staying at a lake house on Logan Martin Lake that accomodates the artists and the residency staff. Meals will be provided and will consist of a prepared dinner and materials for breakfast and lunch.

The areas that we will be visiting are forested and many of the same equipment that you might use camping and hiking will be necessary. There are a number of very swampy areas and waterproof boots are essential. 

## What to bring

Hiking boots/shoes, flashlights (for night field work), a hat, sunblock, towels, long pants, swim suit. Proper rain gear is also essential--the field trips will occur rain or shine.

## Recording Equipment

Each participant is required to bring their own recording gear. Audio recorders, microphones, cables, batteries, data cards, etc. There will be some opportunities for hydrophone recording. There are many modes of recording that will be supported by this residency, however, much of the time the field sessions entail setting up at a site of sonic interest, securing the equipment, and leaving it there to record for 2-3 hours while we move somewhere else nearby. This allows the wildlife to return to the area once the humans have left. Alabama is not entirely remote, and there will may be other human activity in the areas where we are recording. Theft is unlikely but possible, and this should be considered on a site-by-site basis when we are recording in this manner. There will also be opportunities to record in other ways, during short hikes, and overnight. These sessions may produce hours of recordings and this should be considered in terms card space and battery life.

## Studio Equipment

Each participant is required to bring their own studio equipment (e.g. laptop) and all the appropriate cables or adapters necessary to work on their projects. The lake house does have electricity.

## Medical Needs

Each participant is required to have their own health insurance and bring all their necessary medicines with them for the duration of the trip. Please alert the organizers of any medical conditions prior to departure.
