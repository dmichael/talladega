## Natural Setting

Alabama is one of the most biologically diverse states in the United States. This diversity is a product of Alabama's warm, moist climate, it’s great geologic diversity, and its rich evolutionary past. Statewide there are more than 30 species of frogs and toads, nearly 100 species of reptiles, and 420 species of birds that comprise the official Alabama Ornithological Society \(AOS\) state list.

Alabama has four national forests encompassing approximately 667,000 acres of public land and includes 41,000 acres of wilderness area. While much of the land of this rural state has been appropriated for human use, wildlife still inhabits the creeks, hollows, lakes, swamps, and areas in between. Forestry is one of the major industries in the state and harvesting of trees is widespread on both managed and unmanaged land.

The state of Alabama is classified as humid subtropical \(Cfa\) under the Köppen climate classification. The state's average annual temperature is 64 °F \(18 °C\).
