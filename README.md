# About

Talladega is an ecology-focused artist workshop and residency hosted in Talladega, Alabama for two weeks in early June of 2020. Headquartered at a house on Logan Martin Lake, the program is centered around a series of field trips to ecologically important sites in central Alabama with scheduled lectures, studio work, and time for exploration.

2020 will be the first operating year.
