## Michael Clemow

Mike Clemow is a conceptual sound artist based in Brooklyn, NY. His practice is focused around the idea of listening as a creative act and explores the positions of listening and being listened to and what it means to know-with-the-ear. He makes installations, interventions and performances using field recordings, photographs, and objects, placing the artist, or the audience in some relationship with the act of listening, often specific to a particular site or sites.  

Mike graduated from the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU in 2009.  His work has been shown at Exit Art, Spectrum NYC, Dixon Place, AC Institute, Radiator Gallery, The Center for Book Arts, Howl! Happening, and Mana Contemporary.  He has performed in Art in Odd Places 2008, DUMBO Art Festival 2009, Festival MOD (Guadalajara, MX) 2012, River to River Festival 2015, and Movement Research Festival 2017.  He was awarded the Sonic Mmabolela sound art residency in Limpopo, South Africa in 2013 and 2015; BSMT Residency at Mana Contemporary 2016-2017; LABVERDE 2017; LMCC Workspace Residency 2017-2018; and IDEALab New Rochelle, NY.
